# Music Trends Analysis (Spotify Audio Features)
Analyzing music trends based on Spotify audio features, song popularity, and recommendation system efficiency. Interactive Tableau dashboard can be found [here](https://wanjing4.github.io/Spotify-Analysis/).
## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze music trends based on various audio features and assess the factors influencing song popularity.

## Research Questions
#### [1. Which songs have popularity >= 80, and who are their artists? What are the commonalities of their songs?](#popular-songs-analysis)
#### 2. Will key and mode affect the song's popularity?
#### 3. Spotify sometimes recommends songs that have similar audio features. Does the weight on this recommendation algorithm perform well?

## Key Metrics and Dimensions
- **Popularity**: The popularity score of each song (range: 0-100).
- **Audio Features**: Characteristics such as tempo, loudness, energy, and danceability.
- **Key & Mode**: Tonal properties that might influence popularity.
- **Recommendation Efficiency**: Evaluation of Spotify’s recommendation algorithm.


## Summary of Insights
### [Popular Songs Analysis](#1.-which-songs-have-popularity->=-80,-and-who-are-their-artists?-what-are-the-commonalities-of-their-songs?)
- Alhtough number of pop music in a whole is lower than other genre, about 30% of high popular music is pop: ![5d501b7f76517a6a3346a89f27605a9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2060300e-3e60-4419-9aee-775295bc621f)
