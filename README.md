# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores data analysis techniques using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means clustering, and Hypothesis Testing. The objective is to analyze the trends of music based on audio features, song popularity, and recommendation system efficiency using a dataset from Spotify

## Research Question
1. Which songs have popularity >= 80, and who are their artists? What are the commonalities of their songs?
2. Will key and mode affect the song popularity?
3. Spotify sometimes recommends songs that have similar audio features. Does the weight on this recommendation algorithm perform well?





## Features and Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Perform correlation matrix analysis and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Analyze the most popular songs and their common characteristics.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Validates the statistical significance of key and mode on song popularity.
- **Tableau for Data Visualization**: Generates insightful plots to interpret clustering results, PCA transformation, hypothesis test outcomes, and a visualization of the summary of audio features to identify trends in popular music.
