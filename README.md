# Music Trends Analysis (Spotify Audio Features)
Analyzing music trends based on Spotify audio features, song popularity, and recommendation system efficiency. Interactive Tableau dashboard can be found [here](https://wanjing4.github.io/Spotify-Analysis/).
## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze music trends based on various audio features and assess the factors influencing song popularity.

## Research Questions
#### 1. Which songs have popularity >= 80, and who are their artists? What are the commonalities of their songs?
#### 2. Will key and mode affect the song's popularity?
#### 3. Spotify sometimes recommends songs that have similar audio features. Does the weight on this recommendation algorithm perform well?

## Key Metrics and Dimensions
- **Popularity**: The popularity score of each song (range: 0-100).
- **Audio Features**: Characteristics such as tempo, loudness, energy, and danceability.
- **Key & Mode**: Tonal properties that might influence popularity.
- **Recommendation Efficiency**: Evaluation of Spotify’s recommendation algorithm.


## Summary of Insights
### [Popular Songs Analysis](#1.-which-songs-have-popularity->=-80,-and-who-are-their-artists?-what-are-the-commonalities-of-their-songs?)

- High-popularity songs share common attributes in tempo and energy.
- Some artists consistently produce high-popularity songs, contributing to trends in the industry.
### Key and Mode Analysis
- Statistical testing showed that certain keys and modes correlate with higher popularity, though not conclusively.
### Recommendation Algorithm Analysis 
- The effectiveness of Spotify’s recommendation system was assessed, with suggestions for improving weighting of audio features.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
